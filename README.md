# Robust Support Solution Attendance Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to the **Robust Support Solution Attendance Dashboard**. This application is developed using **Streamlit** and **Python** for **Robust Support and Solution (Robust SNS)**, a backoffice solution provider for **Xclusive Trading Inc.** The purpose of this system is to manage and track the attendance of employees working at Robust SNS, providing insights into various aspects of attendance management such as monthly records, late analysis, absences, paid leaves, remaining leaves, and data visualizations related to late arrivals.
